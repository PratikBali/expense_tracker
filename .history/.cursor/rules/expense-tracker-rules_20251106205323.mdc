# Cursor Rules for Expense Tracker Project

## File Organization Rules

### AI-Generated Files
- Always move AI-generated test files, temporary files, and experimental code that are not actively used in the workspace to the `ai/` folder
- This includes files like test scripts, connection testers, debugging scripts, and other temporary AI-generated code
- Only keep AI-generated files in the main workspace if they are actively integrated into the application

### Markdown Files
- Do not create or add `*.md` files outside the `ai/` folder
- All documentation, notes, and markdown files should be placed inside the `ai/` folder
- Exception: `README.md` in the root directory is allowed if explicitly requested by the user

### Cleanup
- After completing tasks that generate temporary or test files, clean them up by moving them to the `ai/` folder
- Keep the workspace organized and free of unused AI-generated artifacts

## User Preferences
- Do not use hardcoded user-facing text; prefer internationalization or configuration-based text management
